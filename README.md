Timestamp Microservice created for a challenge from FreeCodeCamp.com

https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice/

This was made with Cloud9 (c9.io) and Node.js.
## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
